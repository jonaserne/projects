# AI & Automation Portfolio

Welcome to my project portfolio.  
This space collects selected work related to AI-driven automation, content generation, workflow optimization and lightweight Python tools.

The goal of this portfolio is to provide clear, practical examples of how I approach automation challenges — from content pipelines and social media workflows to data processing and productivity assistants.

More projects will be added soon.  
Each repository will include a short description, screenshots, and code that illustrates a specific automation use case.

## Focus Areas
- AI-assisted content creation  
- Automated social media workflows  
- PDF and micro-product generation  
- Data cleaning and normalization  
- Productivity tools using Python and GPT models  
- End-to-end workflow design for small businesses and creators  

## Purpose
This portfolio is designed for clients and collaborators who want to see how I build, structure and document automation solutions.  
All projects are lightweight, easy to understand and focused on real business value.
